 ## Build the latest version
 
-For those wanting to try the very latest version, build etcd from the `master` branch.
-[Go](https://golang.org/) version 1.6+ (with HTTP2 support) is required to build the latest version of etcd.
-etcd vendors its dependency for official release binaries, while making vendoring optional to avoid import conflicts.

+For those wanting to try the very latest version, build etcd from the `master` branch. [Go](https://golang.org/) version 1.7+ is required to build the latest version of etcd. To ensure etcd is built against well-tested libraries, etcd vendors its dependencies for official release binaries. However, etcd's vendoring is also optional to avoid potential import conflicts when embedding the etcd server or using the etcd client.
 
-Here are the commands to build an etcd binary from the `master` branch:
+First, confirm go 1.7+ is installed:
 
-```
+```sh
 # go is required
 $ go version
-go version go1.6 darwin/amd64
+go version go1.7.3 darwin/amd64
 
-# GOPATH should be set correctly
-$ echo $GOPATH
-/Users/example/go
+```
 
-$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/coreos
-$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coreos
+To build `etcd` from the `master` branch without a `GOPATH` using the official `build` script:
+
+```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/coreos/etcd.git
 $ cd etcd
 $ ./build
 $ ./bin/etcd
-...
+```
+
+To build a vendored `etcd` from the `master` branch via `go get`:
+
+```sh
+# GOPATH should be set
+$ echo $GOPATH
+/Users/example/go
+$ go get github.com/coreos/etcd/cmd/etcd
+$ $GOPATH/bin/etcd
+```
+
+To build `etcd` from the `master` branch without vendoring (may not build due to upstream conflicts):
+
+```sh
+# GOPATH should be set
+$ echo $GOPATH
+/Users/example/go
+$ go get github.com/coreos/etcd
+$ $GOPATH/bin/etcd
 ```
