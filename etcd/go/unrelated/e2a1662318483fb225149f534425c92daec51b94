 ### Building
 
-etcd is installed like any other Go (golang >= 1.1) binary. The steps below will put everything into a directory called etcd.
+To build etcd run the build script. This will generate a binary in the base directory called `./etcd`.
 
 ```
-mkdir etcd
-cd etcd
-export GOPATH=`pwd`
-go get github.com/coreos/etcd
-go install github.com/coreos/etcd
+./build

 ```sh
-./bin/etcd
+./etcd

 This will bring up a node, which will be listening on internal port 7001 (for server communication) and external port 4001 (for client communication)
