 # Snapshot Migration
 
 You can migrate a snapshot of your data from a v0.4.9+ cluster into a new etcd 2.2 cluster using a snapshot migration. After snapshot migration, the etcd indexes of your data will change. Many etcd applications rely on these indexes to behave correctly. This operation should only be done while all etcd applications are stopped.

The memory consumed by each individual watching accounts for the largest portion of etcd's overall usage, and is therefore the focus of current and future optimizations.

By creating a list of production use cases we hope to build a community of advisors that we can reach out to with experience using various etcd applications, operation environments, and cluster sizes. The etcd development team may reach out periodically to check-in on your experience and update this list.

 # Proxy
 
 etcd can run as a transparent proxy. Doing so allows for easy discovery of etcd within your infrastructure, since it can run on each machine as a local service. In this mode, etcd acts as a reverse proxy and forwards client requests to an active etcd cluster. The etcd proxy does not participate in the consensus replication of the etcd cluster, thus it neither increases the resilience nor decreases the write performance of the etcd cluster.

 If a cluster permanently loses a majority of its members, a new cluster will need to be started from an old data directory to recover the previous state.
 
-It is entirely possible to force removing the failed members from the existing cluster to recover. However, we decided not to support this method since it bypasses the normal consensus committing phase, which is unsafe. If the member to remove is not actually dead or you force to remove different members through different members in the same cluster, you will end up with diverged cluster with same clusterID. This is very dangerous and hard to debug/fix afterwards.

 If you have a correct deployment, the possibility of permanent majority lose is very low. But it is a severe enough problem that worth special care. We strongly suggest you to read the [disaster recovery documentation][disaster-recovery] and prepare for permanent majority lose before you put etcd into production.
